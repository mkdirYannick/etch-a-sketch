# etch-a-sketch
This project is part of the odin project course.

The goal is to create a grid using javascript and css and make each square change color by clicking and hovering above each of them.

Several functions have been added:
    - Rainbow mode: Generate a random color for each new square
    - Pencil mode: incrementally darken the squares from light gray to black
    - Eraser: Delete the background color of the squares
    - Pixel size: Dynamically change the size of the grid to make each squares bigger or smaller
